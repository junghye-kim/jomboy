      <p class="text">I’m currently a Senior Audience Analyst at the New York Times.
        I graduated from Dartmouth in 2019 with a degree in Quantitative Social
        Science which basically just means I spent four years trying to understand
        what makes humans do what they do. <br><br> I’m a Jomboy media fan and
        think this is such an exciting moment for the company. I enjoy creative,
        fast paced environments, and think that I could be an asset to y’alls team.
        I really believe in what you all are doing and would love to be a part of it.</p>

      <p class = "text">Build a product that becomes an integrated part of peoples’ lives
Create multiple entry points in order to capture a broader range of fans
Build more ~ intimate ~ interactions for audience members to build deeper engagement
Thoughtfully diversify the content portfolio - this current model isn’t sustainable
Build out more everlasting content - not tied to a specific moment in time
Invest more heavily in the website - diversifies your consumption channels to protect against rapidly shifting media platforms
Analytics - data isn’t everything. As we’ve seen with the Yankees, if you forget that your data driven decisions impact people you’ve already lost. Invest in collecting
Homebase to anchor to vs. trying to start multiple independent successful pods
